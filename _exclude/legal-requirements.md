# Legal requirements 
Created by Benny, last modified by Gert on 2019-05-07
When presenting a Resurs Bank payment method there are some legal
requirements that should be adhered to:
1.  The customer should be warned that a credit check might be done when
    using payment methods of type NEW_ACCOUNT and type INVOICE but not
    when using type CARD.
2.  If data returned by
    [getCostOfPurchaseHtml](getCostOfPurchaseHtml_4653091.html) are
    used, it should be possible to reach within a click from where our
    payment methods are marketed.
3.  If the links returned with
    [getPaymentMethod](getPaymentMethods_950328.html) are used, those
    should be shown where the corresponding payment methods are
    marketed.
