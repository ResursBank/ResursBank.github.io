# Magento Plugin Releases (Download) 

Since we do have more than one Magento-plugin (depending on which
Magento and flow you need), all plugin releases are documented in the
primary space of [Magento modules](magento-modules).

## Older releases of the deprecatedFlow plugin
As of january 2017, we have completely switched over to Bitbucket, but
there is still an older archive available with prior releases of Magento
1x-deprecated flow located
at [https://test.resurs.com/autodocs/magento-oldflow-archive/](https://test.resurs.com/autodocs/magento-oldflow-archive/) if
you really need to look at them.
