Behaviour of saltkey fields changed (scopes)  
Callbacks changed to support multiple websites (scopes)

GetAddress issues for vanilla fixed. Application-Government-Id now
inherits data from the getaddress-field (#11678)

Disabled cache-flushing each time salt keys are updated in control panel

as a html entity in the soapcall  
Fixed a copy problem in Model/Cron.php

(Onestepcheckout)  
Some payment-methods generate errors when \$length in the form is not
defined (Affecting both Onestep and vanilla-magentos)

Letting Resurs Bank generate a session id instead of using microtime()
or uniqid() for doing this  
Patches for Firecheckout should only be delivered via patch-files, not
through the installation package  
Secured Api.php against undefined variable errors (during debug mode)  
Custom statuses works better with magento's states  
Changed supported countries from multiselect to single selection   
Password expiration callback throttler added (If too many requests are
received in the same time, throttle password-changes and only accept the
first received request)  
form.phtml in design/base vs design/default resynched since they
differ  
Throttle of payment methods implemented in the prepareSigning-method (on
failed signings)

#### 1.1.34:
Checking count of methods instead of returning unreadable soap error in
cron.php  
password_expiration and identifier, safer digest controls for multiple
passwords in indexcontroller  
Promotion codes should not be rounded (Tax problem)  
Another tax-problem on while using promotion codes (depending on when
the discount should be applied - before or after tax) are fixed  
Added extra exception for some javascript-calls in IndexController
(regarding sh_a_GovId and sh_a_Mob)  
First prevention of headers aleady sent from indexcontroller by changing
\$dynamicFormHtml \$rowdata (placing the variable on one row seem to
solve problems)  
Fixing a bunch of variables that needs to be defined to be used properly
(if not, they are generating "undefined variable"-errors)  
Firecheckout patch for submitlimitapplication: Empty variables returned
gives us problems with undefined variables (found on addressrow2)  
htmlentities() removed from id and artNo in speclines (Model/Api.php)
due to conflicting long names on encoding
