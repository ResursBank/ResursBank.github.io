# Checkout Integration, initial notes / tips / FAQ 

Resurs Checkout is a full hosted iframe based checkout solution, with
the purpose of getting started faster with a checkout, that you don't
have to build by yourself from scratch. This is a small guide for how
implementation could be done.
The development could be made in a few different ways, depending on your
needs.

For PHP we use our in-house developed library [PHP and development
libraries](PHP-and-development-libraries_5014349.html), to utilize the
functions of making calls to both Resurs Checkout and our other
shopflows. EComPHP are able to handle the creation of the Resurs
Checkout iFrame, including updating orders when OmniJS (or similar) is
active. EComPHP uses an [open source
solution](https://developer.tornevall.net/apigen/TorneLIB-5.0/class-TorneLIB.Tornevall_cURL.html) ([Develop-Snapshot](https://developer.tornevall.net/download/TorneLIB-5.0/raw/tornevall_network.php))
when it comes to handling http calls, therefore an activated cURL-module
in PHP is required.
