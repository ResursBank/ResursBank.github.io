# Calculations with getAnnuityFactors/part payments (EComPHP) 

EComPHP has internal functions to calculate annuity factors (or "part
pay from" on for example single product page views where customers wants
to know how much they need to pay per month). The function called by
EComPHP is basically getAnnuityFactors, but intead of letting
intergrators/developers calculate the factors by themselves, EComPHP
does this for you. The primary function to do this is
getAnnuityPriceByDuration, where you push in the total price of a
product, the factors you want to use when you calculate the amount, and
finally the duration time of how long the payment should  be "alive" (12
months, 24 months and so on).

```xml
$payFrom = $flow->getAnnuityPriceByDuration(10000, 
    'PARTPAYMENT',
    12
);
```
In this example we will get 833 SEK out of the response based on our
chosen payment method.

> Unfortunately, that function is not an automated function that gives

## Further description of what getAnnuityPriceByDuration do in its calls
As you can see below, you're quite free of what you send into the
question. You can either send the getAnnuityFactors-object directly into
the method and save some time with it (if you for example have it
cached). If you don't have this and want as live information as
possible, the \$paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject can be used to send for
example the payment method name "PARTPAYMENT". Doing this, will first
resolve which factors that belongs to the payment method and THEN after
this start the calculation.

```xml
    /**
     * Get annuity factor rounded sum by the total price
     *
     * @param $totalAmount
     * @param $paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject
     * @param $duration
     *
     * @return float
     * @since 1.1.24
     * @throws \Exception
     */
    public function getAnnuityPriceByDuration($totalAmount, $paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject, $duration)
    {
        $return = 0;
        $durationFactor = $this->getAnnuityFactorByDuration($paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject, $duration);
        if ($durationFactor > 0) {
            $return = round($durationFactor * $totalAmount);
        }
        return $return;
    }
    /**
     * Get annuity factor by duration
     *
     * @param $paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject
     * @param $duration
     *
     * @return float
     * @throws \Exception
     * @since 1.1.24
     */
    public function getAnnuityFactorByDuration($paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject, $duration)
    {
        $returnFactor = 0;
        $factorObject = $paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject;
        if (is_string($paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject) && !empty($paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject)) {
            $factorObject = $this->getAnnuityFactors($paymentMethodIdOrFactorObject);
        }
        if (is_array($factorObject)) {
            foreach ($factorObject as $factorObjectData) {
                if ($factorObjectData->duration == $duration && isset($factorObjectData->factor)) {
                    return (float)$factorObjectData->factor;
                }
            }
        }
        return $returnFactor;
    }
```
