# Prefilled customer data (EComPHP) 

To pre-set customer data in Resurs Checkout from for example logged in
user data you could do something like below. This is an example grabbed
from the WooCommerce plugin. As described below, to give effect to
another billing address for RCO you push data into the delivery address
the same way you normally do in the simplified flow. Also remember that
if you want to add other data like phone, e-mail (and government id,
that is just an empty string in the below example) you need to set this
data via setCustomer() in EComPHP.

*Currently as the feature is quite new, it has to be enabled with the
ECom-flag **KEEP_RCO_DELIVERY**. See below. There is also a
**KEEP_RCO_BILLING** available in case something else should be
acutalized in the future. However, the plan is rather to make those two
flags unused once reaching production properly.*

```xml
private function getDataFromCustomerObject($billingObject, $key) {
        $return = '';
        if (isset($billingObject[$key])) {
            $return = $billingObject[$key];
        }
        return $return;
    }
/// Another function goes here.
if (is_user_logged_in()) {
            $this->flow->setFlag('KEEP_RCO_DELIVERY', true);
            $loggedInCustomer = new WC_Customer(get_current_user_id());
            $loggedInBilling = $loggedInCustomer->get_billing();
            $this->flow->setCustomer(
                '',
                '',
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'phone'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'email'),
                'NATURAL',
                ''
            );
            $this->flow->setDeliveryAddress(
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject(
                        $loggedInBilling,
                    'first_name'
                ) . ' ' . $this->getDataFromCustomerObject(
                        $loggedInBilling, 'last_name'
                ),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'first_name'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'last_name'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'address_1'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'address_2'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'city'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'postcode'),
                $this->getDataFromCustomerObject($loggedInBilling, 'country')
            );
        }
```
