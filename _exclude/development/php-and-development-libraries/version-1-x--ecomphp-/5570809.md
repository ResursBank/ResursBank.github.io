# EComPHP: getCostOfPurchaseHtml (Automated) 
Created by Thomas Tornevall, last modified by Benny on 2017-03-02
**Reference:** [Get Cost of Purchase
(HTML)](getCostOfPurchaseHtml_4653091.html)
A method to retrieve detailed cost of purchase information in HTML
format. EComPHP has a function to automate this with proper HTML-headers
and CSS.
# CSS
If \$returnBody is true and \$callCss is in use, this is the base
content of the CSS that is needed by default:
- body {}
- .header {}
- .headHeader {}
- .headText {}
- .priceTable {}
- .evenRow {}
- .oddRow {}
- .content {}
- .tailText {}
- .legalInfoLink {}  
## CSS generated by \$returnBody
-  .cost-of-purchase-box {}
## Usage example
As the function states here, you may set \$returnBody to true to get
standard HTML-tags with head and body from the call.
    getCostOfPurchase($paymentMethod = '', $amount = 0, $returnBody = false, $callCss = 'costofpurchase.css', $hrefTarget="_blank")
[Sample CSS file for getCostOfPurchase (from the
WooCommerce-plugin)](../../../../attachments/5570809/6521016.css)
 
**getCostOfPurchaseHtml()**
``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
$costOfPurchaseHtml = $flow->getCostOfPurchase("INVOICE", 1337, true, "/mysite/css/costofpurchase.css", "_blank");
return $costOfPurcaseHtml;
```
