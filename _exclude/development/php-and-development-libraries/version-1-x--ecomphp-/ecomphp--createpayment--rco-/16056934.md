# Failurls in RCO-payload (EComPHP) 

The failurl sometimes requires encoding to properly work with redirects
from Resurs Bank.

Using a failurl that is fully encoded may however not be entirely
compatible with the ecommerce solutions especially when it comes to "not
nice urls". A "nice" url is a rest-looking url where no ? and &
parameters are required. Instead
of [http://www.test.com/index.php?parameter1=true](http://www.test.com/index.php?parameter1=true),
a nice URL looks like this:

    http://www.test.com/index/parameter1/true/
To avoid such problems, we can as of march 2019, push encoded urls into
the payload. But when we push a **http%3A%2F%2F**-formatted urlstring
into the signing/failurl-blocks (in this case in the iframe), Resurs
ecommerce responds with a "malformed url"-exception instead of accepting
it. So we need to properly encode the url by the path only. However, to
make it possible to change this in the future (if this is at some point
fixed at Resurs Bank) we use bitwise methods to decide **how** we'd like
to encode the url. This is an example from PrestaShop on how we do
handle encoded urls:

**Using setSigning()**
```xml
$this->ecom()->setSigning(
    $this->getSuccessUrl(),
    $this->getBackUrl(),
    false,
    null,
    RESURS_URL_ENCODE_TYPES::FAILURL +
    RESURS_URL_ENCODE_TYPES::PATH_ONLY
);
```
In this case we ask EComPHP to set the successUrls and failurl, but
*not* backurl (it will go null here, since hosted flow is the only flow
that wants to know about a backurl).

Besides of this, the last parameter setup tells EComPHP to only encode
the failurl. However, since Resurs did not support fully encoded urls,
we ask EComPHP to only encode the pathway of the url. By means, the url
will be encoded like this:

    https://www.test.com/%3Fparameter1%3Dvalue1%26parameter2%3Dvalue2.
When we go through a test flow where we decide do "mockfail", the
redirect will be done as is above. In worse cases, we can also add the
bitflag **LEAVE_FIRST_PART**. This means that the PATH will be encoded,
but only after the first part of the string. By means, our encoded url
will look like this: 

    https://www.test.com/?parameter1=value1%26parameter2%3Dvalue2
Both above cases can be tested here:
