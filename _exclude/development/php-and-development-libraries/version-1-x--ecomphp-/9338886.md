Creating payments behaviour for the checkout is very much like
the [Simplified shopflow](7438490), except for the fact that you
*almost* only need to display an iframe on the webpage instead of
integrated web forms.

> Payload noticeAs of v1.1.22 (+1.0.22), the payload will reset after
> each successful call to this method. Prior versions just cleans up the
> internal orderlines. The new way to handle the payload, opens for
> multiple calls in the same "EComPHP session".

## Initialize the module
```xml
use \Resursbank\RBEcomPHP\ResursEnvironments;
$preferredEnvironment = ResursEnvironments::ENVIRONMENT_TEST;
$this->rb = new \ResursBank( $this->username, $this->password, $preferredEnvironment );
// or
$this->rb = new \ResursBank( $this->username, $this->password );
$this->rb->setEnvironment($preferredEnvironment);
```
## Successful orders vs unsuccessful orders - Setting rules of signing (Flow requirement)
This part works much like [the simplifed shopflow](7438490).

Before proceeding, we need to configure the payment to handle signings;
if we for some reason require that your customer signs the payment -
this happens for example, if you set a delivery address that mismatches
with your billing address. If you have your own requirements (for
example, you want to force signing every time a payment are created)
this part is also important. Besides, without the rules of signing,
Resurs Bank won't accept the payment. But the setup is quite simple. You
need to set up two urls for this: One for successful signings and one
for signings that fails during the payment process.

**setSigning()**
```xml
$this->rb->setSigning("https://mystore.test.com/signingSuccessful", "https://mystore.test.com/signingFailed", false);
```
In EComPHP v1.1.22 or later you can solve this with lesser confusion
(see below). Basically, setCheckoutUrls are passing over the variables
to the setSigning()-function.

```xml
$this->rb->setCheckoutUrls("https://mystore.test.com/signingSuccessful", "https://mystore.test.com/signingFailed");
```

Running this will prepare for eventually letting the customer sign the
payment. The boolean false tells Resurs Bank to not force any signing.

### The syntax for setSigning is as follows:

| Parameter    | Type    | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| successUrl   | string  | Tells Resurs Bank where your payment, when successful, will land (*Thanks for your order*, normally).                     |
| failUrl      | string  | The opposite to successUrl. When customers for some reason fails through making the order this is where they should land. |
| forceSigning | boolean | Forced signing. **Deprecated and won't have any effect in future releases of the API.**DEPRECATED                         |
| backUrl      | string  | Backurls is normally used for hosted flow, where customers can return to the checkout without fulfilling anything.        |

## Set the preferred payment service
First, we need to prepare EComPHP for which payment flow we want to use.
In this case, we'll tell EComPHP to use the checkout. To maintain some
kind of backwards compatibility,
both METHOD_RESURSCHECKOUT and METHOD_OMNI still works.

```xml
$this->rb->setPreferredPaymentService(ResursMethodTypes::METHOD_CHECKOUT);
```
Compared to the [simplified shopflow](7438490) you do not need to
prepare much more than some basic data. For example, you can skip all
inbound customer data at this point. Data about the customer is handled
by the checkout iframe, and could be catched with some help from for
example [ResursCheckoutJS](5570788), depending on how the integration
looks.

One other thing you however need though, is a payment reference
(orderid) to create the order with. If your store supports the ability
to create an order reference before creating the order, you should use
this method to set up the iframe. If this is not supported, you can do
this in some ways:

1.  Create a random, temporary order reference, to build the iframe.
    During the iframe order completion, lock the submit button ([Get
    inspired with ResursCheckoutJS](5570788)), create the order in the
    store and return the handle to the checkout.
    1.  If you need to rename the order reference to match with your
        store, you can in this moment also send a backend-signal to
        Resurs Checkout with help from updatePaymentReference
2.  Create the order on the way back to the checkout (preferrably
    through a customer landing page)
Both of the above method have their own advantages. Some of them are
listed here:

- Creating the order in the store **before** returning the handle might
  create junk orders in the store that will be left untouched if
  something happens in the checkout before the landing page (customer
  aborts, fails or just backs out of the checkout without proceeding)
- Creating the order in the store **after** the checkout process might
  not create the order fully, if the customer aborts or fails in the
  process before the landing page

You can of course create the order after the checkout process, if you
don't want to script anything, and instead use the advantage of
callbacks. This, however, leaves you completely alone with the store API
and you need to take control over anything that can happen in the order
process by yourself. The only thing you can trust at this moment is the
BOOKED callback. When this callback is running, you can do a
**getPayment()** with EComPHP and fetch both the required customer info
and the orderlines. However, like said here, you need to be very
familiar with your stores API and now how to complete a full order
without the help of the customer session.

### Preparing for ResursCheckoutJS or similar solutions
If you decide to use the "[ResursCheckoutJS](5570788)"-method, you need
to be aware that you also need to include an url in the payload handler
that tells the web-browser on which parent URL it can find the iframe
source. EComPHP does this for you, by setting a default URL through the
webserver variables \$\_SERVER\['HTTP_HOST'\]. However, if you require a
"non standard URL" you'll need to use the internal function
**setShopUrl**(). As of version 1.0.22/1.1.22/1.2.0, validation of the
shopUrl are included in EComPHP, to make sure that the shopUrl are
properly formatted. However, this feature must be activated to get
effect.

Setting this:

```xml
$this->rb->setShopUrl("https://my.shop.url/failing/uri/", true);
```
Will render this, in the final payload:

```xml
https://my.shop.url
```
You can also run this, to get similar result:

```xml
$this->rb->setValidateCheckoutShopUrl(); // As of 1.1.22
$this->rb->setShopUrl("https://my.shop.url/failing/uri/");
```
Note: This validation does not validate if the host is real.

## Preparing the cart
A payment is nothing without the cart. In our case, the cart is your
final cart from your store - the payment specification (orderlines). To
create an orderline, you can use **addOrderLine()** for your help, and
as Resurs Checkout this function only requires minimum of data to render
a correct orderline. The data needed is the following:

| Variable               | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \$articleNumberOrId    | The article number or the id (normally a short string that sets the article in your store)                                                                                                |
| \$description          | The longer article description of your                                                                                                                                                    |
| \$unitAmountWithoutVat | The proce of your article, as it was single product (one unit)                                                                                                                            |
| \$vatPct               | The VAT of the product without decimals. If the VAT is 25%, you give 25 as value                                                                                                          |
| \$unitMeasure          | Pcs, pieces, st, styck, kg, etc. Used to describe the quantity on the invoice*"8 pcs of house hold items", "3 kg of meat"*                                                                |
| \$articleType          | (Optional) Used for the checkout to specifiy if the article is shipping, fee or regular. Only needed when it's not a regular article type. Null or empty string works to specify no type. |
| \$quantity             | The quantity                                                                                                                                                                              |

#### Function: addOrderLine()
```xml
$this->rb->addOrderLine(
   "HORSE",
   "Stallponny",
   4800,
   25,
   "st",
   null,
   1
);
```
#### Function: getPayload() returns
```xml
{
    "orderLines": [
        {
            "artNo": "HORSE",
            "description": "Stallponny",
            "quantity": 1,
            "unitMeasure": "st",
            "unitAmountWithoutVat": 4800,
            "vatPct": 25,
            "type": ""
        }
    ]
}
```
## Full example
This example has partially been taken from the EComPHP UnitTest suite
and shows a very basic set up for the checkout, to be enabled:

```xml
$this->rb->setPreferredPaymentService(ResursMethodTypes::METHOD_CHECKOUT);
$iframePaymentReference = $this->rb->getPreferredPaymentId(30, "CREATE-");
$this->rb->addOrderLine(
   "Product",
   "This text describes our product",
   500,
   25,
   "st",
   null,
   1
);
$this->rb->setShopUrl("https://my-iframe-shop.test.com");
$this->rb->setCheckoutUrls("https://google.com/?q=signingSuccessful", "https://google.com/?q=signingFailed", false);
$theFrame = $this->rb->createPayment($iframePaymentReference);
// Display the frame
echo $theFrame;
```
Note that the shopUrl must be set in \<protocol\>://host.name only, or
it may fail on the iframe communications level. However, if this rule is
honored in later versions of EComPHP, like below, the hostname will be
validated and corrected automatically.

```xml
$this->rb->setShopUrl("https://my-iframe-shop.test.com/this/uri/will/be/removed/in/the/final/result");
```
**Output Result for above will be https://my-iframe-shop.test.com**

# Communicating with the iFrame
> postMsg is deprecatedPlease have in mind that the old legacy iframe
> communication is deprecated.

To get a more responsive behaviour for your store, it is possible to
communicate with the iFrame and create an order on the fly, instead of
waiting until Resurs Bank is finished with the order creation.
Basically, this method makes it possible to create an order in the
background (front-end) before the checkout process are taking place in
Resurs e-commerce.

Some advantages of this is that ...

- Your customers may be able to fulfill the order even if the internet
  connection is broken while completing the flow.
- The checkout will be more responsive and support updates of the shop
  cart before the checkout

You should read the section [Iframe communication (v2API)](5570788) if
you want to know more about this, since you need to handle the incoming
data from the iFrame.

> Order flow and denied credits while using OmniJSSince the order has to
> be created in the shop before it is confirmed and created in
> e-commerce, it is important that you, if you get any orders where the
> customer has a denied credit, update the previously created order with
> the proper address data from the customer. If this is not properly
> done, there's a risk that a bad customer could hijack a good
> customer's government ID to fulfill an order.
