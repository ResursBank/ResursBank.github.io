presented on the form are returned and need to be rendered
accordingly.  
Contains elements as defined in the following table.
  
| Component   | Type                                        | Occurs | Nillable? | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| formId      | string                                      | 1..1   | No        | The identity of the form. If a form has been previously filled in by the customer and a new application attempt has to be made for some reason, without any change to the parameters, comparing this identity to the identity on the previous form will show if the new form needs to be presented, or if the same data can be re-submitted. |
