### Introduction
If the customer wants to add a product on an existing order that has not
yet been shipped, you can add it with help of additionalDebitOfPayment.

AdditionalDebitOfPayment makes a new, additional debit on an existing
payment/order. This reserves the amount on the customer's account. If it
is a credit payment, there must be room for the additional debit within
the limit. If the payment method on the other hand is not a card there
is an extra room for later debits/purchases when the limit application
form was filled by the customer.

ItÂ´s also possible to make part debits of a payment. For example, if the
customer has ordered 5 products, it's possible to debit and ship 3 of
these products and wait for the rest of them for unknown circumstances.
This can also be made from **Resurs Merchant Portal.**

### Paymentspec - speclines
> Observe that in order to have an invoice with specified order data,
> make sure to include the speclines in the web service call.

specLines are not mandatory for processing payments.

specLines can vary between start, finalize, credit and annul. It doesn't
matter. Only the sum matter.

specLines make better invoices and help the merchant

The code below shows an example of one paymentSpec row when calling
startPaymentSession method
