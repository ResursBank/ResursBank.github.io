# The "not a bug" list 

On this page, we keep a list of errors and problems that is normally not
related to plugins or installed modules. Sometimes errors are generated
due to missing components or external access is denied from your
platform. Sometimes this happens due to unmet requirements. Here's some
of them. If this page does not cover your problem, you can also take a
look at [Errors, problem solving and corner cases](16056453.html).

| error:**14090086**:SSL routines:ssl3_get_server_certificate:certificate verify failed               | Root certificate bundles are missing on your server, or is placed in a path where your server is not looking.                                                | For PHP cases, this can be fixed by editing your server's php.ini:See the variables for openssl.cafile, openssl.capath.Another solution is to try to add the missing files. In many cases, the missing file is ca-certificates.crt, and in a "standard" Ubuntu platform, they are located in /etc/ssl/certs - openssl usually delivers this file by the dependency ca-certificates (*apt-get install ca-certificates*).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from 'url?wsdl' : failed to load external entity "url?wsdl" | If this error is a "standalone" where only this message is visible, there might be an SSL problem again.                                                     | This is normally either a credential error or a sign that your system is missing enabled ssl-drivers. The [EComPHP](PHP-and-development-libraries_5014349.html)-library is normally trying to defeat this error message by revealing the "true" error since credential errors, especially on older PHP-systems, tend to hide such error messages when credentials are used.[This is a bug in PHP, known since 2006](https://tracker.tornevall.net/browse/NETCURL-67) where 401-Unauthorized errors are being handled as notices rather than a "real" exceptions, and is normally not catched by PHP. This is probably not fixed since PHP 7+ should be able to handle this better (unconfirmed). |
