# EComPHP custom errorcodes 
Created by Thomas Tornevall, last modified on 2019-10-08
EComPHP, when errors occurs, renders own fault codes when something goes
wrong. A sample of what codes that is used can be read [from this
point](https://bitbucket.org/resursbankplugins/resurs-ecomphp/src/master/source/classes/rbapiloader/ResursException.php).
A part of this list includes the SOAP faultcodes
[here](/development/errors--problem-solving-and-corner-cases/resurs-error-codes/).

Except for this EComPHP passes errors from the engine that handles the
communication with ecommerce rest/soap. Those exceptions can be found
[here](https://docs.tornevall.net/x/EgCNAQ)Â and will not be included
here as third party applications might change over time. This list does
not cover the section ECOMMERCEERROR either, as that section covers
external errors for Resurs Ecommerce.

| 1006 | *UNKOWN_SOAP_EXCEPTION_CODE_ZERO* | Exceptions that occurs in EComPHP SOAP caller - postService() - where the postService has reached an exception, checked all possibilites of a proper error message but where the EComPHP for a reason can't catch a code. Instead, EComPHP gets an empty value or the value 0 as the errorcode. In this case, to ensure that the exception is thrown correctly, it generates this code instead of the "real" value. |
