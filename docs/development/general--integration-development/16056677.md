> \* Country settingResurs Bank merchant credentials only supports one
> country per credential account. Merchants that allow shopping from
> multiple countries need to have one credential for each country
> (Sweden, Norway, Finland or Denmark). I.e., a Norwegian customer can
> not shop with payment methods in a Swedish store.

> \*\* Callback noticesCallbacks must be reachable externally. If you
> are testing your web store in a protected environment and you want to
> test callback functionality, you have to make sure that Resurs can
> reach the callback URLs.
