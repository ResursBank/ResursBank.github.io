1.  Option to enable and disable the module.
2.  Option to enable switch between test and production environment at
    Resurs Bank.
3.  End points for [production](3440987.html) and
    [test](Test-URLs_2097164.html) environment.
4.  Country of merchant credentials.\*
5.  Usernamn provided by Resurs Bank.
6.  Password provided by Resurs Bank.
7.  Callback implementation.\*\*  
    You can use either [SOAP](Register-Event-Callback_1475892.html) or
    [REST](Resurs-Checkout-Web_5014022.html) to register callback.  
    [Read more](Callbacks_327724.html) how to use and implement
    callbacks.
  
\* Country setting
Resurs Bank merchant credentials only supports one country per
credential account. Merchants that allow shopping from multiple
countries need to have one credential for each country (Sweden, Norway,
Finland or Denmark). I.e., a Norwegian customer can not shop with
payment methods in a Swedish store.
\*\* Callback notices
Callbacks must be reachable externally. If you are testing your web
store in a protected environment and you want to test callback
functionality, you have to make sure that Resurs can reach the callback
URLs.
