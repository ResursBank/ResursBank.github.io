# formElement 
Created by Benny, last modified on 2017-02-27
The detailed specification of the form element. While new form elements
might pop up, [we have a few which you can look out
for](Concepts-and-Domain_950279.html#ConceptsandDomain-Anchor_LimitApplications)
(if you happen to have the data the form element requests, or need the
data from a particular form element).Â

| label          | string                            | 0..1   | No        | The form element label. Typically, this is displayed as the field header.                                                                                                                                                |
| description    | string                            | 0..1   | No        | A textual description of the form element. Typically, this is displayed when the user hovers the mouse pointer over the element.                                                                                         |

| default-value  | string                            | 0..1   | No        | The default value.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| option         | **[option](option_1475765.html)** | 0..\*  | No        | If the form element has a predefined set of possible values, these are presented as a list.                                                                                                                              |
