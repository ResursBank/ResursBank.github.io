> are tempted to run tests in the live enviroment. Please don't The main
> consequence is that credit applications are made and these are saved
> by credit agencies (like UC). Later, when new credits are considered,
> these old applications will be weighted in. A lot of credit
> applications in a short period of time looks suspicious.
