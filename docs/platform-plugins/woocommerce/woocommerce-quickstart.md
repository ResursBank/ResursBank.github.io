# QuickStart Guide WooCommerce

_Sign an agreement with Resurs Bank to get credentials for production._

## 1. Acquire test credentials

Contact Resurs Bank to request your test credentials. Make sure that your system meets all technical requirements before
proceeding with the integration.

## 2. Installation

Install the plugin via WordPress plugin repository (the plugin manager
in wp-admin). It is NOT recommended to install the plugin manually since
you will miss all automatic upgrades.
