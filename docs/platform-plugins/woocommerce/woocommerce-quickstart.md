# QuickStart Guide WooCommerce

# 1. Acquire test credentials

Contact Resurs Bank to get your test credentials for MAPI.

# 2. Installation

Install the plugin via WordPress plugin repository (the plugin manager
in wp-admin). It is NOT recommended to install the plugin manually since
you will miss all automatic upgrades.
