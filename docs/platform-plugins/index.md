#### Fee notes

*Fees are supported in WooCommerce in the way that if you add fees with an external plugin, they will be added to the
order sent to Resurs Bank. However, the plugin does not handle fees itself.*

## Maintaining Compatibility

**The more plugins you activate that handles your layout - and changes
the default** **behavior** **of regular styling - the more the risk that
the plugin won't work as intended.**

## PHP Platform Requirements

Most of our new plugins work with Merchant API. Merchant API are in PHP cases driven with Ecom2, our library that
handles the communication with MAPI. Ecom2 requires PHP 8.1 or higher versions. For MAPI, you also need a token
compatible version of cURL. Make sure **CURLAUTH_BEARER** is available.

> The plugins listed and provided from this page are open source and

> integrations as part of their IT job.

> It is your sole responsibility to test and make control that
> the plugin works properly within your platform. If it doesn't work,
> feel free to contact us via onboarding@resurs.se. Do not launch our
> plugins straight into a production server, before checking those steps.

> That said, it is not a guarantee that it fits or works with
> all solutions. Also, if you feel you want to modify the plugins and
> share it, fork the projects from Bitbucket and create your pull
> request for us. The things you do may be useful for others.
